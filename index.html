        <h1>Art Museums</h1>
        <p>In Europe, from the Late Medieval period onwards, areas in royal palaces, castles, and large country houses
          of the social elite were often made partially accessible to sections of the public, where art collections
          could be viewed.At the Palace of Versailles, entrance was restricted to people of certain social classes,
          wearing the proper apparel – the appropriate accessories (silver shoe buckles and a sword) could be hired from
          shops outside.
