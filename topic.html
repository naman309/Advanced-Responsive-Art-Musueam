        <p>
          Leap Advantage is the programme through which we help high school students receive quality education for almost half the cost. Most undergraduate courses abroad are expensive and, at times, unaffordable for many. With the Leap Advantage Twinning Program, you can begin your undergraduate studies in India, and, after completing two years, take a transfer to the US and graduate with an international degree. This not only helps you save up to 50% of the program fee but also gives you access to a plethora of internship and job opportunities in the US. We also offer a Course Credit Program to help you earn US college credits while in high school. Also, we provide you with scholarship assistance and opportunities using which you can ‘earn while you learn.’ Check out Leap Advantage for more information.
